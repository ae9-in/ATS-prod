# ATS Platform (TalentOS)

Enterprise Applicant Tracking System (ATS) with role-based access, candidate management, pipeline workflows, interview management, reporting, exports, and in-app notifications.

## 1) Project Status (E2E)

This project is **working end-to-end** for core ATS flows:

- Authentication + role-based route protection
- User management (Super Admin)
- Candidate CRUD + search + duplicate prevention + bulk upload
- Resume upload + candidate custom fields + candidate history
- Job creation + active/closed management
- Application creation + pipeline stage movement + shortlist
- Interview scheduling + feedback submission + voice recording upload
- Analytics + reports + Excel/PDF export
- In-app notification center (bell, unread badge, mark read)
- CI smoke validation

---

## 2) Tech Stack

- Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind + Framer Motion
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
- Uploads: Multer (local disk)
- Exports: XLSX + PDFKit

---

## 3) Stakeholder & Role Mapping

From ATS requirements:

- Super Admin -> `SUPER_ADMIN`
- Internal Users (HR/Recruiters) -> `RECRUITER`
- Hiring Team / Interviewers -> `INTERVIEWER`

---

## 8) Seed Users (Default)

From `backend/prisma/seed.js`:

- `admin@ats.local` / `ChangeMe@123` (SUPER_ADMIN)
- `recruiter@ats.local` / `ChangeMe@123` (RECRUITER)
- `recruiter2@ats.local` / `ChangeMe@123` (RECRUITER)
- `interviewer@ats.local` / `ChangeMe@123` (INTERVIEWER)
- `interviewer2@ats.local` / `ChangeMe@123` (INTERVIEWER)

---

## 9) Local Setup & Run

Project root:

```bash
npm run install:all
npm run dev
```

Backend only:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Frontend only:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Prisma setup:

```bash
cd backend
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:migrate
npm run prisma:seed
```

---

## 10) QA / Validation Commands

Backend smoke check:

```bash
cd backend
npm run ci:smoke
```

Frontend production build:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

If smoke test shows `fetch failed`, ensure backend is running on `http://localhost:4000` and check:

```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :4000
```

---

## 11) CI/CD

Workflow files:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/cd.yml`

CI includes:
- frontend install + build
- backend install
- PostgreSQL service
- Prisma migrate + seed
- backend startup + smoke test

CD includes:
- build artifacts
- deployment placeholder pipeline (replace with real target deploy commands)

---

## 12) What Is Completed vs Pending

### Completed
- Core ATS lifecycle from candidate intake to interview and reporting
- Role-aware access and protected frontend routes
- Reporting and export baseline
- In-app notification center
- Security middleware baseline (headers, rate limiting, payload guard)

### Pending / Next Hardening Layer
- Advanced shortlist UX polish across large datasets
- Richer analytics drilldowns (cohort/source/time trend depth)
- Production-grade notification channels (email/SMS/Slack delivery, not just in-app)
- Cloud file storage (S3/GCS/Azure Blob) instead of local uploads
- Comprehensive automated tests (frontend e2e + backend integration suites)
- Deployment hardening (Docker, reverse proxy, TLS, observability)

---

## 13) Notes

- Demo data may include extra records created during smoke/E2E tests.
- For a clean dataset, reset DB and run Prisma migrate + seed.
- Theme consistency is maintained across enterprise pages with shared layout and styles.
